# loginUI
Please use HTML and CSS.
The project must meet the following requirements:

The Login box must be centered in the screen and stay in the center of the screen even as you resize the web-browser.
This should be relatively easily acomplished with flexbox.
The login box should have a minimum size, and the input fields or text in the box should not leak out of the box.
The login box should have box-shadow and rounded edges.
The login box should have a username and password input field
If you can, please make sure text entered into the password field is hidden (with asterisks or circles)
The login box should have a button

Additional things you are welcome to experiment with:
-Other Designs for Logins
-Pictures as backgrounds or part of the Login UI
-Adding additional features to the login
